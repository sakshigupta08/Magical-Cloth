# Magical-Cloth
As we all have been a great fan of Harry Potter, we always wish if we could have those magics. Being a potter head i was fascinated to the cloak used by hatter to be inivisible. So I made a program that could do the same. I used python, OpenCV and HSV color model. I basically used the idea of super imposing two images and display the final image.
